 * This struct represents the states of a single object property, to be used in a motion operation. Because the `start` and `end` properties can represent any value type, it is used to create `Motion` objects that conveniently handle many property value interpolations by simply passing in representations of that object at its starting and ending points.
 *
 * - remark: These state values must be of the same object type as the property located at the keypath. For instance, if the `path` property points to a CGRect object, you must provide CGRect objects for the `start` and `end` properties.
