/**
 *  EasingBack provides easing equations which move beyond the specified starting and ending values and snap back, as if attached to a rubber band. With modest overshoot values, this easing type can provide a more organic feel when animating visual elements like UIViews and UI.
 *
 *  - remark: See http://easings.net for visual examples.
 *  - warning: These equations produce easing values extending beyond the starting and ending values, which may produce unpredictable results for properties which have strict bounds limits.
